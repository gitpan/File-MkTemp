1.0.2 - Changed from File::Spec::Functions to File::Spec->catfile.  This allows
        backward compat for older File::Spec module.
        Added mkstemp() function that returns an open file handle.
        Corrected $keepgen = 0 to $keepgen == 0 at the next stmt.
1.0.1 - Started using File::Spec to create the directory/tempfile string.
        This is better so that the function can be used on different os.
1.0.0 - First release to public.  mktemp() function.
