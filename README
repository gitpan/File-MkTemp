File::MkTemp 1.0.5 -- Modules to create unique strings for use as file/directory
                      names etc.


If you use this with perl earlier than 5.005 you will need to obtain
the File::Spec module.

To install this module:

	perl Makefile.PL
        make test (optional)
	make install

Now be good and clean up:
        make realclean
   or
        delete the directory:)
